/**
 * Session scan corpus — reconstructed P0 observations from the Engine Trace of

 *
 * FIDELITY NOTES:
 *  - observations are lifted verbatim from the trace's P0 Observations block
 *    (type/clue/description/confidence).
 *  - `negated`/`hard_negative` are INFERRED. Critically, they are set to match
 *    what the ORIGINAL run did, not what is "correct" — e.g. jute_webbing here
 *    means "No webbing" but the engine treated it as a positive clue, so
 *    negated=false. That reproduces the as-seen outcome; a #17 fix is tested by
 *    flipping it and re-running.
 *  - perception is minimal (raw_text empty); downstream maker-matching reads the
 *    label/visible_text observation descriptions, which are present.
